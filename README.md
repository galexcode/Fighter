You need a Mac with XCode or something that runs iOS.

You need the first one to install things on the last one, unless you're in the future.
In that case, well done!

I used Cocos2d and art I purchased from a store online.
As soon as I remember the name of that store I'll post a really nice link to them right here.  I'll probably even put lights around it and emphasize it with a bold font point.  Because the art is great and I did not make it.

What I did do was use art to create animations for sprite sheets.
I basically had the parts and pieced them together using animation guidelines from an old picture that looked like it was from the 40's.....for real.

Ok so other than that, if you use this for the basis of anything, let me know.
Hopefully you'll improve it or do something completely unexpected that results in good things.
